# RandomNotes

This is a collection of random notebooks, including simulations and checks to verify (in the size of 1 notebook) aspects of fMRI analysis in general, smoothness stuff, peaks in random fields, variables related to neuropower etc.  The folder `collections_I_need_to_sort` looks worse than the average garbage bin, but the avid investigator can find some useful stuff in there.  I've started cleaning and annotating, so here are a few things you can find here:

- **anticorrelations:** Sometimes anticorrelations are in the advantage for an fMRI design.  This notebook (Rmd) gives an overview and simulations showing this effect.
- **validating_fmri:** In December 2017 I gave a short course on _`Using R to analyse fMRI data`_ and _`Validating fMRI using real data`_ in Leiden to biostatistics grad students.
